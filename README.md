Remote Mini - DIY Bluetooth Camera Shutter
Welcome to the official open-source repository for the DIY version of the Remote Mini, a project by Film Oddments.

We decided to share the design and code for this compact, multi-function Bluetooth camera remote so that the DIY community can build, learn from, and enjoy it. This project involves 3D printing, basic electronics assembly, and programming an ESP32 board.

**Features**
- Shutter Trigger: Instantly capture photos with a press of a button.
- Bulb Mode: Keep the shutter open for long exposure shots.
- Timer Mode: Set a timer for hands-free shooting.
- Timed Bulb Mode: Automatically control long exposures with a preset timer.
- Shutter Depth Adjustment: Fine-tune the press depth for half-press and full-press functionality.
- Manual release

**Files in this Repository**
/3D_Models: Contains all the .STL files required for 3D printing the enclosure.
/Code: Includes the Arduino source code (.ino) for the ESP32.
/Schematics: The circuit diagram for wiring the components.

**Assembly & Installation**
3D Print: Print all the parts from the /3D_Models folder.

Wiring: Solder the components together according to the circuit diagram found in the /Schematics folder.

Code Upload: Open the .ino file from the /Code folder in the Arduino IDE, and upload it to your ESP32 board.

Final Assembly: Carefully place the electronics inside the 3D-printed case and secure it.
